# Autuminal
This project is a simple terminal-based journalling/todo-list app. It reads/write to two files : todo.txt, in which you can put a todo item on each line, and it will be displayed in the app, and journal.log, where everything you type then pess enter in the journal box in the app is saved.
# Running
You can choose the correct binary for your CPU architecute in the Release tab (sadly for now only Linux is supported, as I have trouble getting the size of the terminal on Windows)   
 
You can also git clone the repo and run it directly with ```go run .``` inside the cloned directory.
